This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from iNaturalist dataset. </br>

## Code Organization
```
â”œâ”€â”€ partA      # Building and training a CNN from scratch
â”œâ”€â”€ partB      # Finetuning pre-trained model 
â””â”€â”€ CS24M012_Assignment2.pdf       # Report
```

Both partA and partB contains readme files in their respective directories explaining the methodologies and running scripts
